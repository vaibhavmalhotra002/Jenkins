<h1>Multi Stage Multi Agent</h1>
<h4> I have Set up a multi stage jenkins pipeline where each stage is run on a unique agent. 
  I will use this very useful approach when I have multi language application or application that has conflicting dependencies.
(for e.g when frontend ,backend & database require different agents)</h4>
